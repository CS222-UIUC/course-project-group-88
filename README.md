Classify is a site that allows users to input their schedule and select a subject, and find UIUC courses which fit in their schedules.
Currently, Classify displays classes from the Spring 2023 course catalog.

Classify is a git pages site built using Node.js. It utilizes webscraped data on sections of UIUC courses, and a python script which takes a schedule and a subject as an input, and returns the courses and sections which the user could fit into their schedules. 

Our site has 3 main components:

The Frontend, primarily made by Taisia Kalinina.

The Backend, primarily made by Eli Kujawa.

The Webscraper, primarily made by Pratim Vasireddy.

All of us (Taisia, Pratim, and Eli) were involved in connecting these 3 components.
