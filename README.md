# course-project-group-88

Group Members: Minhyung Lee (ml90), Eli Kujawa (ekujawa2), Pratim Vasireddy (pvv2), Taisia Kalinina (taisiak2)

Pitch: We propose a website which allows UIUC students to input their schedules and find classes which would fit into their schedules. They will be able to sort classes by subject, gen-ed requirements, walking time, and seat availability.
